class QgsProfilePlotRenderer : QObject
{
%Docstring(signature="appended")
Generates and renders elevation profile plots.

This class has two roles:

1. Extraction and generation of the raw elevation profiles from a list of :py:class:`QgsAbstractProfileSource` objects.
2. Rendering the results

Step 1, involving the generation of the elevation profiles only needs to occur once. This is done via
a call to :py:func:`~startGeneration`, which commences generation of the profiles from each source in a separate
background thread. When the generation is completed for all sources the :py:func:`~generationFinished` signal is
emitted.

After the profile is generated, it can be rendered. The rendering step may be undertaken multiple times
(e.g. to render to different image sizes or data ranges) without having to re-generate the raw profile
data.

Constructor for QgsProfilePlotRenderer, using the provided list of profile ``sources`` to generate the
results.

    ~QgsProfilePlotRenderer();

    void startGeneration();
%Docstring
Start the generation job and immediately return.
Does nothing if the generation is already in progress.

    void cancelGeneration();
%Docstring
Stop the generation job - does not return until the job has terminated.
Does nothing if the generation is not active.
%End

    void cancelGenerationWithoutBlocking();
%Docstring
Triggers cancellation of the generation job without blocking. The generation job will continue
to operate until it is able to cancel, at which stage the :py:func:`~QgsProfilePlotRenderer.generationFinished` signal will be emitted.
Does nothing if the generation is not active.
%End

    void waitForFinished();
%Docstring
Block until the current job has finished.
%End

    bool isActive() const;
%Docstring
Returns ``True`` if the generation job is currently running in background.
%End

    QgsDoubleRange zRange() const;
%Docstring
Returns the limits of the retrieved elevation values.
%End

%Docstring
Renders a portion of the profile to an image with the given ``width`` and ``height``.
%End

  signals:

    void generationFinished();
%Docstring
Emitted when the profile generation is finished (or canceled).
