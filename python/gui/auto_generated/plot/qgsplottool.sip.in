class QgsPlotTool : QObject

%Docstring(signature="appended")
Abstract base class for all interactive plot tools.

Plot tools are user tools for manipulating and interacting with a :py:class:`QgsPlotCanvas`.

  public:

    ~QgsPlotTool();

    virtual Qgis::PlotToolFlags flags() const;
%Docstring
Returns the flags for the plot tool.
%End

    virtual void plotMoveEvent( QgsPlotMouseEvent *event );
%Docstring
Mouse move ``event`` for overriding.

The default implementation does nothing. When subclasses implement this method
and have acted on the event, they must explicitly call event->:py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.accept` to prevent
the event from being passed on to other widgets.
%End

    virtual void plotDoubleClickEvent( QgsPlotMouseEvent *event );
%Docstring
Mouse double-click ``event`` for overriding.

The default implementation does nothing. When subclasses implement this method
and have acted on the event, they must explicitly call event->:py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.accept` to prevent
the event from being passed on to other widgets.
%End

    virtual void plotPressEvent( QgsPlotMouseEvent *event );
%Docstring
Mouse press ``event`` for overriding.

The default implementation does nothing. When subclasses implement this method
and have acted on the event, they must explicitly call event->:py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.accept` to prevent
the event from being passed on to other widgets.
%End

    virtual void plotReleaseEvent( QgsPlotMouseEvent *event );
%Docstring
Mouse release ``event`` for overriding.

The default implementation does nothing. When subclasses implement this method
and have acted on the event, they must explicitly call event->:py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.accept` to prevent
the event from being passed on to other widgets.
%End

    virtual void wheelEvent( QWheelEvent *event );
%Docstring
Mouse wheel ``event`` for overriding.

The default implementation does nothing. When subclasses implement this method
and have acted on the event, they must explicitly call event->:py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.accept` to prevent
the event from being passed on to other widgets.
%End

    virtual void keyPressEvent( QKeyEvent *event );
%Docstring
Key press ``event`` for overriding.

The default implementation does nothing. When subclasses implement this method
and have acted on the event, they must explicitly call event->:py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.accept` to prevent
the event from being passed on to other widgets.
%End

    virtual void keyReleaseEvent( QKeyEvent *event );
%Docstring
Key release ``event`` for overriding.

The default implementation does nothing. When subclasses implement this method
and have acted on the event, they must explicitly call event->:py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.accept` to prevent
the event from being passed on to other widgets.
%End

    virtual bool gestureEvent( QGestureEvent *event );
%Docstring
Gesture ``event`` for overriding.

Returns ``True`` if the event was handled by the tool and should not be propagated further.
%End

    virtual bool canvasToolTipEvent( QHelpEvent *event );
%Docstring
Tooltip ``event`` for overriding.

Returns ``True`` if the event was handled by the tool and should not be propagated further.
%End

    bool isActive() const;
%Docstring
Returns ``True`` if this tool is the current tool active on the plot canvas.
%End

    virtual void activate();
%Docstring
Called when the tool is set as the currently active plot tool.
%End

    virtual void deactivate();
%Docstring
Called when the tool is being deactivated.
%End

    virtual void clean();
%Docstring
Called when the tool should clean up.
%End

    QgsPlotCanvas *canvas() const;
%Docstring
Returns the tool's plot canvas.
%End

    virtual bool populateContextMenuWithEvent( QMenu *menu, QgsPlotMouseEvent *event );
%Docstring
Allows the tool to populate and customize the given ``menu``,
prior to showing it in response to a right-mouse button click.

``menu`` will be initially populated with a set of default, generic actions.
Any new actions added to the menu should be correctly parented to ``menu``.

A pointer to the plot mouse ``event`` can be provided to allow particular behavior depending on the plot tool.

This method can return ``True`` to inform the caller that the menu was effectively populated.

The default implementation does nothing and returns ``False``.

.. note::

   The context menu is only shown when the ShowContextMenu flag
   is present in :py:func:`~QgsPlotTool.flags`.
%End

  signals:

    void activated();
%Docstring
Emitted when the tool is activated.
%End

    void deactivated();
%Docstring
Emitted when the tool is deactivated
%End

  protected:

    QgsPlotTool( QgsPlotCanvas *canvas /TransferThis/ );
%Docstring
Constructor takes a plot canvas as a parameter.
%End

    QgsPoint toMapCoordinates( const QgsPointXY &point ) const;
%Docstring
Converts a ``point`` on the canvas to the associated map coordinate.

May return an empty point if the canvas point cannot be converted to a map point.
%End

    QgsPointXY toCanvasCoordinates( const QgsPoint &point ) const;
%Docstring
Converts a ``point`` in map coordinates to the associated canvas point.

May return an empty point if the map point cannot be converted to a canvas point.
%End
